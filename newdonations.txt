Another great day of {gdq}. Love {watching} my {childhood} {games} get destroyed. Money goes to {save} the {animals}, {kill} the {frames}.

Thanks to the runners and those working behind the scenes, glad to donate to such a worthy cause. Put this donation towards runner's choice!


Glad I managed to catch this run

Love AGDQ as always, hope you can get those mad splits today.

Good job Lack, and all the runners who have participated throughout the week, such a good thing you're doing!

Brought me lots of fun watching all these runners destroy these games.

Let's get hype and good luck to all the runners and everyone helping behind the scenes!

This makes me want, and may the RNG be with you.

Another great day of {gdq}

Thanks to the runners and those working behind the scenes.

Raising money for a good cause

Greetings from Germany! Long time viewer, first time donator here. My grandfather passed away recently after a long battle with cancer so what you guys are doing is awesome! I had to donate during one of my favorite games of all time. This AGDQ has been awesome and I have been losing sleep because of you guys. I love seeing my childhood being destroyed in these speedruns. Shoutouts to the runners and people who made this possible. Keep up the good work and let's kick cancer in the butt! Remember, save frames, not the animals. Everybody say HOYP!
